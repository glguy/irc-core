# Revision history for glirc

## 2.40.0.1

* Build on GHC 9.0

## 2.40

* vty-6 support
* deduplicated /url
* locally processed /who
* locally processed /list
* colorized channel identifiers
* better channel and user-mode highlighting. highlights are now per-server so configuration files will need to be updated
* support for 24-bit color output
* OS notification support
* More notification levels for each window
* Better away status handling
* Config file level window hint configuration

## 2.39

* Extra oper commands and reply parsing
* Account tracking with account-tags
* Added matterbridge hook
* Support SASL SCRAM
* Add locked editor mode (F7)
* Add `tls-verify` to specify expected certificate hostname

## 2.38

* Avoid ping timeout disconnects while other packets are still arriving
* Add `never-highlights` configuration setting to stop common words from being treated as nicknames
* Add a multi-line editor mode (default toggle with F6)
* More tolerate nickname completion
* Preserve server names in server replies (visible in detail view)
* Window names are persistent rather than alphabetical. Manage them with `/setname` and `/setwindow`
* Added hook for extension to query window lines
* More complete rendering for rare server replies
* Prettier columns in `/names`
* Add small scroll with Meta-PgUp/PgDown
* Built-in support for `/umode` for changing user modes (a common macro previously)
* Support strikethrough formatting (can require terminfo edits on common terminals to see it)
* Removed DCC support

## 2.37

* Add `/new-self-signed-certificate PATH [keysize]` to make it easier to configure secure services logon
* Add STARTTLS support: `tls:` configuration settings are now: `yes`, `no`, `starttls`
* Add separate `tls-verify: no` setting for disabling hostname verification instead of old `tls: yes-insecure`
* Configuration file supports `$` macros and `@load` / `@splice` directives from config-value

## 2.36

* **Changed executable name to `glirc`**
* Allow all windows (not just chat message windows) to be added as split-screen targets
* Chose a random nickname when list of alternatives is exhausted
* Add simple man page
* Add `/monitor`
* Support specifying `bind-hostname` to pick a local address to connect
  from in favor of `protocol-family`. To pick a protocol family you
  can now specify `bind-hostname: "0.0.0.0"` or `bind-hostname: "::"`
* Add TLS key PEM password configuration
* Make all configuration file passwords able to be loaded from executing a command
* Make SASL mechanism specification specific and support an optional
  authorization identity `authzid` used in rare circumstances but
  supported by SASL.

  ```
  sasl: -- example 1
    mechanism: plain -- sasl defaults to plain if not specified
    username: "myuser"
    password: "mypassword"

  sasl: -- example 2
    mechanism: external
    authzid: "otheruser" -- optional

  sasl: -- example 3
    mechanism: ecdsa-nist256p-challenge
    username: "myuser"
    private-key: "path/to/my.key"
  ```

  Note that now using a client-side TLS certificate is an independent
  configuration from using EXTERNAL. To use both you need to configure
  both!

* Added `protocol-family` configuration option. Set to `inet` or
  `inet6` to force a particular IP protocol.

## 2.24

* `/query` now takes a message parameter and tab-completes
  like `/msg`.

## 2.23

* CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGE: Relative paths are now resolved
  from the directory of the configuration file. The "~" alias
  for the home directory works for resolving paths relative
  to $HOME. Absolute paths are unmodified.

  and the wiki for more information.

  wrap to where the message portion of the line started.

  via `/reload`

  using the "detailed" image for regular expression matching.

  `motd`, `version`, `lusers`, `kill`, `knock`, `list`.
