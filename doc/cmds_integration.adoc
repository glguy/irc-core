== /znc

Send command directly to ZNC.

The advantage of this over `+/msg+` is that responses are not broadcast to call clients.

== /znc-playback

Request playback from the ZNC `playback` module.
Note that the playback module is not installed in ZNC by default!

When `date` is omitted, uses the most recent date in the past that makes sense.
When both `time` and `date` are omitted, all playback is requested.

Time format: `HOURS:MINUTES` (example: 7:00)

Date format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY` (example: 2016-06-16)
